When building in VS 2013 you will be alerted about incorrect value '1800' blah blah should be '1600'.
This means that you should rebuild the libraries in vs 2013. Yeah, boring.
Eventually you can install VS 2010, but it will take some disk space.

But the fun is:
Open solution, build it (I preffer _PCH, as of it's imba faster, if you get error like 'blah blah inconsistent values between game and something /Ym' just right click on game->Project Only->clean only game).
Then:
Open /bin/your_build_method/lib/shared.lib
with notepad++ (or other text editor, but not notepad, notepad is lame)
and replace all _MSC_VER=1600 to _MSC_VER=1800

Note: match case in _MSC_VER=1600 will result in replacing 0 things. Don't check it, just write _MSC_VER=1800 in caps. :P
Shared.lib should replace 42 items.

???
PROFIT!
Core builds and starts. You can write code and test if it's working.
It's bad and hacky and oh god they will shout at me for this, but it's working.
I'm going to hell for this. :c

If you are going to do something important which is really connected with those libs you should do it 'as should be done', not this way. But for casual use - priceless.
